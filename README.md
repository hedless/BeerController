# BeerController
Initially this is for a school project but working it to hopefully better control my beer fermenting process.
This will be used to turn a cooling unit on and off to keep the beer in good temp range.  
Plus it will inspect how the surrounding environment settings are affecting the speed of temp change such as outside temperature and humidity.
Will hopefully be updating this more and more as time goes on to make an automated system for the beer all the way from mashing to pouring from the tap.  :)
